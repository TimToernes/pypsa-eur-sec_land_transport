Description
-----------
The (Python) code stored in the present Git repository implements two (toy) models both using [PyPSA](https://pypsa.readthedocs.io/en/latest). These represent an exogenous-driven land transport and an endogenous-driven land transport. The main purpose of the (toy) models is to get familiar with PyPSA and energy system modelling in general. This familiarity will help enabling [PyPSA-Eur-Sec](https://pypsa-eur-sec.readthedocs.io/en/latest) with endogenous-driven land transport capabilities afterwards.
