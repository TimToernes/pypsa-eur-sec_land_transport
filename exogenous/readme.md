Description
-----------
The (Python) code stored in the present folder implements a exogenous-driven land transport (toy) model using (PyPSA)[https://pypsa.readthedocs.io/en/latest]. The main purpose of this implementation is to get familiar with PyPSA and energy system modelling in general. This familiarity will help enabling (PyPSA-Eur-Sec)[https://pypsa-eur-sec.readthedocs.io/en/latest] with endogenous-driven land transport capabilities afterwards.
